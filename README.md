# UppyDowny
This is the official implementation and "IDE" of my esoteric language [UpDown](https://esolangs.org/wiki/UpDown), built with [WPF](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/desktop/wpf/).

Currently, this is VERY basic, and the implementation hasn't actually been, well, implemented yet.

For downloads, go to [releases](https://github.com/IdfbAn/UppyDowny/releases).
